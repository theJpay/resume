          <h4>Adaptivity</h4>
          <p>
            During a match, I have to constantly think about what I should do in
            order to win. But my oponent won't wait for me. Therefore, I have to
            take the right decision in a blink of an eye, reacting to what my
            oponent is doing with the right gesture and winning point after
            point, decision after decision.

          <h4>Competitivity</h4>
          <p>
            A competition is never won or lost before actually doing it. That's
            why every time I do something, I give my best. Even if my oponent is
            one point away from victory I will continue to believe that I can
            comeback and try to surpass myself. Every defeat that I experienced
            were lessons that I learned and helped me being better, in fencing,
            but also at work.

          <h4>Teamwork</h4>
          <p>
            Fencing is never learned alone. And it is the same at work. Even if
            what I produce myself is what I did, the ideas, the practice and the
            reflexions all come from the people around me. I couldn't be a good
            fencer without all my partners around me to train with and helping
            me improve my qualities and erasing my flaws.
